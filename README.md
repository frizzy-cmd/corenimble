# 🚀 Core Nimble (Latest stable version: ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0--release-blue))

**The ultimate "lightweight" browser for legacy/low-end computers** ⏩

Nimble, also knows as Core Nimble is a high-performance, chromium-based browser engine specifically tuned for low-end, legacy hardware. While modern browsers eat 500MB just to show a blank page, **Core Nimble keeps it under 30MB on idle. No bloat, no tracking, just speed, security, and convenience.**

## ❓ Why Core Nimble?

* **⚡ Ultra-Lightweight:** A single Google tab on idle uses only **24 MB** of RAM.
* **🧠 Intelligent Memory:** Built-in **RAM Limiter** and **Auto-Tab Suspension** to keep your 4GB or 8GB system from dying.
* **🎮 GPU Tuned:** Optimized for **old NVIDIA graphic cards,** using ANGLE/D3D11.
* **💢 Seamless Updates:** Upgrading to a new version? Nimble keeps your profile and logins safe, so you can jump right back in.
* **👻 Privacy First:** Integrated "Ghost Mode" for incognito browsing that doesn't save to history, **Ghost Mode runs completely off your RAM, ensuring no traces.**

## 🛠️ Optimization

For the best experience on legacy hardware:
1.  **Disable software rendering in Settings** [unless your graphics card is having a problem]
2.  Set your **RAM Limit to ~1024MB or 2048MB** if you only have 4GB total.
3.  Let **Tab suspension** handle background tabs so your CPU stays cool.

## 📦 Installation

1.  Download `corenimble_installer_v1.0.0.exe` from the releases.
2.  Run the installer
3.  Enjoy!

## ❗ Notes
* **⚠️ Work in Progress: This is an Alpha release. Expect some bugs**
* **🎨 UI Aesthetics: The interface is currently "function over fashion." It's a bit plain, but it's built to save your RAM.**
* **🧩 Missing Features: Extension support (Adblock, etc.) and a "Clear cache" button are currently missing but planned for future versions, You can clear cache by going to %localappdata%\corenimble and deleting the cache folder.**
* **💾 Data Handling: On the Portable version, history and bookmarks are saved to the local PC's AppData folder. If you're on a public computer, you'll need to delete the corenimble folder in %localappdata% manually to delete your history, bookmarks and et cetera.**
* **🚀 Software Rendering: Please, turn this OFF in settings unless your screen is flickering. Your GPU (even an old graphics card) will handle the browser way better than your CPU, Unless you know what you're doing, or your current graphics card is having a problem, you may turn it on.**

## 💭 Plans
* **💻 I will release Linux support shortly, please be patient!**
* **📱 Mobile support may release, but due to the complexity and due to me being the only developer, this may not happen.**
* **🔓 The code will be open source shortly, once everything is stable, This is a alpha version, Expect bugs. Sorry!**
