# 🚀 Core Nimble (Latest ver: ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.8--alpha-blue))

**The ultimate "lightweight" browser for legacy/low-end computers** ⏩

Nimble, also knows as Core Nimble is a high-performance, chromium-based browser engine specifically tuned for low-end, legacy hardware. While modern browsers eat 500MB just to show a blank page, **Core Nimble keeps it under 30MB on idle. No bloat, no tracking, just speed, security, and convenience.**

## ❓ Why Core Nimble?

* **⚡ Ultra-Lightweight:** A single Google tab on idle uses only **24 MB** of RAM.
* **🧠 Intelligent Memory:** Built-in **RAM Limiter** and **Auto-Tab Suspension** to keep your 4GB or 8GB system from dying.
* **🎮 GPU Tuned:** Optimized for **old NVIDIA graphic cards,** using ANGLE/D3D11.
* **👻 Privacy First:** Integrated "Ghost Mode" for incognito browsing that doesn't save to history, **Ghost Mode runs completely off your RAM, ensuring no traces.**

## 🛠️ Optimization

For the best experience on legacy hardware:
1.  **Disable Software Rendering in Settings** [unless your graphics card is having a problem]
2.  Set your **RAM Limit to ~1024MB** if you only have 4GB total.
3.  Let **Tab Suspension** handle background tabs so your CPU stays cool.
